title: "Faking GoGuardian"
---

If you disable GoGuardian using mush or similar methods, you'll need to install a fake version to prevent your administrator from seeing that you've disabled it. This guide will walk you through the process of installing FakeGuardian, a fake version of GoGuardian that works exactly the same as the real thing, but doesn't block any websites.

This guide assumes you have some way to disable or break the original GoGuardian extension.

## Prerequisites

- A way to access the ChromeOS shell (type `shell` in crosh)
- Visual Studio Code
- Murkmod installed (optional, but recommended)

## Section I - Dumping the GoGuardian Extension

In order to make a fake version of GoGuardian, we'll need to dump the extension from a device that has it installed. This is because each extension is unique to the device it's installed on, and we can't just download it from the Chrome Webstore or provide it for you to download.

### Step 1 - Finding the Extension ID

First, we'll need to find the extension ID of GoGuardian to dump it.

1. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

2. Find the GoGuardian extension and click on the "Details" button.

3. The extension ID will be the long string of characters in the URL. Save this somewhere for now. (chrome://extensions/?id=**extension-id**)

### Step 2 - Dumping the Extension

Now that we have the extension ID, we can dump the extension.

1. Open the ChromeOS shell by typing `shell` in crosh.

2. Run the following command, replacing `EXTENSION-ID-HERE` with the extension ID you found earlier:

```sh
mkdir /home/chronos/user/Downloads/goguardian-dump && cp -r /home/chronos/user/Extensions/EXTENSION-ID-HERE /home/chronos/user/Downloads/goguardian-dump
```

## Section II - Modifying the Extension

Now that we have the extension dumped, we can modify it to make it use a fake server instead of the real GoGuardian server. This will allow us to control what the extension does and prevent it from blocking (most) websites.

### Step 1 - Opening the Extension Code in Visual Studio Code

1. Copy the `goguardian-dump` folder from your Downloads to somewhere you can access it with Visual Studio Code (whether that's on your Chromebook via Linux or on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev)).

2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code, If you're using [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev), you can drag and drop the folder onto the page.

### Step 2 - Modifying the Extension Code

1. Open the find and replace tool on the left side of the screen (icon looks like a üîç magnifying glass).

2. In the "Find" box, type `panther.goguardian.com` and in the "Replace" box, type `panther.clickette.net`.

3. Click on the "Replace All" button (looks like the below image). This will replace all instances of `panther.goguardian.com` with `panther.clickette.net` (the fake server). This will automatically save the changes.

4. Repeat the process for `x3-predictor.goguardian.com/v3/predictions` and `panther.clickette.net/v3/predictions`.

Replace All button:

### Step 3 - Preventing the Extension from Overwriting the Original

1. Open the find and replace tool on the left side of the screen (icon looks like a üîç magnifying glass).

2. Beside the "Find" box, click on the **`.*`** button to enable regular expressions.

3. In the "Find" box, type `\s*"key":.*`, and keep the "Replace" box empty.

4. Click on the "Replace All" button. This will remove the private key from the extension, preventing it from overwriting the original ID.

## Section III - Installing the Fake Extension

Now that we have the extension modified, we can install it on your device. Note that this will only work if you have developer mode enabled on the `chrome://extensions` page.

### Step 1 - Packing the Extension

1. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

2. Enable developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner if it isn't already enabled.

3. Click on the "Pack extension" button.

4. In the "Extension root directory" box, select the `goguardian-dump` folder. No need to select a private key file.

5. Click on the "Pack extension" button. This will create a `.crx` file beside the `goguardian-dump` folder.

### Step 2 - Installing the Extension

This part is pretty simple. Just drag and drop the `.crx` file onto the `chrome://extensions` page, and it should install the extension.

## Section IV - Next Steps

Now that you have FakeGuardian installed, you can continue to use your Chromebook without worrying about GoGuardian blocking websites. 

Do note the following information:

- We don't yet know if the administrator/teacher can see that you're visiting blocked websites. *Use at your own risk.*
- Certain websites may still be blocked by the extension for an unknown reason, possibly cached data or custom client-side logic.
- The extension will not be updated automatically, so you'll need to repeat the process if the extension is updated.
