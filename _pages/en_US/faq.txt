<summary><u>Can my admin see that I've unenrolled?</u></summary>

Yes, your administrator can see that you've unenrolled *if you haven't used fakemurk or murkmod*. More specifically - your network administrator will be able to see that the "Last Sync Date" on your Chromebook will be slowly drifting into the past. However, there is no indicator saying, "This device is not enrolled".

<summary><u>Are there any risks of permanently damaging my Chromebook?</u></summary>

Short answer: No. Slightly longer answer: Not unless you fuck up really, *really* badly. Basically, just follow the instructions and you'll be fine.

<summary><u>Help! I got a "ChromeOS is Missing or Damaged" screen and don't know what to do!</u></summary>

Use a recovery drive. If ChromeOS refuses to load it, check that you got the right board on [Chrome100](https://chrome100.dev/). If that doesn't work, make sure that this screen isn't intentional, as it is in fakemurk.
